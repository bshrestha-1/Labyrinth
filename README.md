# Labyrinth Game

Welcome to Labyrinth Game! Iâ€™ve been developing this board game concept during my weekends. I am creating a digital prototype to test the gameplay mechanics. I plan to bring it to life as a physical board game if it proves successful.

This interactive board game is implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Players take on the roles of Runners and Chasers, navigating a labyrinth filled with challenges and strategic card plays.
